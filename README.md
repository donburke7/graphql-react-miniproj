# graphql-react-miniproj
Short LinkedIn Learning project using GraphQL and React.js to create a personalized Github Repository viewer.

This project follows along [this](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-graphql-project-with-react-js/why-use-react-with-graphql-for-projects?u=42272537) LinkedIn Learning course, taught by Ray Villalobos.

## Goal and Learning Outcomes
My goal with this project was to get started with GraphQL and apply it in a manner that allows me to gain a very basic understanding of how it functions when used with a popular framework such as React.js.

### With this project I learned: 
- A little bit of Bootstrap
- How to create and customize a React.js project
- How to implement a GraphQL query using JavaScript
- The importance of pagination
- How to use GitHub's GraphQL Explorer, Graph*i*QL, to retrieve data from GitHub

## To run:
Simple `npm install` and then an `npm start` should get 'er goin.
